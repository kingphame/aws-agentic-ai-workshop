   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set Up AWS CLI**:
   Configure your AWS CLI with:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
   Provide your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, region, and output format.

3. **Deploy AWS Resources**:
   Use the provided scripts to deploy necessary AWS resources:
   ```bash
   bash deploy_resources.sh
   ```

4. **Verify Installation**:
   Run the following command to ensure everything is set up correctly:
   ```bash
   python check_setup.py
   ```

## Usage

Once your environment is set up, you can start using the tools provided in this workshop. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how to run the examples:

1. **Run a Sample Agent**:
   To test an agent, execute:
   ```bash
   python run_agent.py
   ```

2. **Train a Model**:
   Use SageMaker to train your model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. **Generate Content**:
   To generate content using Bedrock, run:
   ```bash
   python generate_content.py
   ```

4. **Manage Data Workflows**:
   Use Strands to manage your data by running:
   ```bash
   python manage_data.py
   ```

Refer to the individual scripts for more detailed usage instructions and parameters.
